# Product Development Plan

## 3D Buggy Adapt

Develop an adaptive kit that can improve the postural support provided in a mainstream buggy.

> Bespoke mainstream buggy postural support

### Why?

Specialist buggies for children with disabilities and postural support needs can be expensive and heavy. They have additional supportive elements for the child and will often be manufactured to be suitable for use in transport with the child sat in the buggy. This adds weight, complexity and development cost. It is still recommended that children should be transferred to a car safety seat when travelling in a vehicle as they are designed for this purpose.

Mainstream pushchairs and buggies often lack the supportive elements in the right places and of the right rigidity. They might not have the strength and adjustability required for a child with postural needs.

This package will adapt an existing mainstream travel system to provide the postural requirements.

### Key Features

1. Width adjustable pelvic lateral support
2. Seat depth adjustment
3. Height and width adjustable thoracic laterals
4. Head support
5. Pelvic strap
6. Chest harness
7. Adjustable height footrest
8. Allow for growth

It will use a travel system that has:

1. Tilt
2. Folds and fits in a car boot
3. Optional rain/sun cover

This might include postural support options to improve symmetry and loadbearing for a child in a pram in supine. Will also need to consider the difference between a Travel System and Stoller.

## 3D Form Shell Back

Develop a process that uses a 3D scan of bean bag cushion to produce 3D printed elements that can be positioned on a wheelchair backrest shell to provide a custom contour.

> Digital manufactured custom contoured backrest

### Why?

Using an additive rather than a subtractive manufacturing process that scales easily will help to reduce lead times and manufacturing costs. 

Custom contoured wheelchair seating is typically manufacturing by machining a large foam block on a CNC machine to the required size and profile. To enable finishing, this needs to be oversize which leads to a high material and processing cost and time. 

This product will include a modular structural “shell”. Shells are often used in active wheelchair backrests to provide the structural integrity for the foam covering. This system will be modular and adjustable to reduce stockholding and options. This will allow reuse with a replacement cushion.

Due to the design of existing systems, it can be difficult for users to dissipate heat and moisture. They do not allow for growth and can be expensive if there are errors in manufacturing or casting.

### Key Features

1. Scan bean bag cast
2. Translate to surface required in CAD
3. 3D print individual components to provide contour under cushion
4. Attach elements in one orientation
5. Position standard backrest foam with options
6. Built-in height adjustability 50mm
7. Built-in width adjustability 50mm
8. Depth adjustable with replacement lateral wings
9. Ability to add headrest from other manufacturers

The shell will use an existing mounting system initially to reduce development time such as V-trak. Cushion arrangement similar to that used in Jay or Matrx backrest.

* [Invacare Matrx Backs](https://www.invacare.co.uk/pressure-care-seating/matrx-backs/invacare-matrx-elite-e2-back-series-new)

While it is possible to add postural elements to provide additional contouring to these backs, you need specific expertise to position these correctly.

## 3D Form Seat
Uses the skills and knowledge developed with the wheelchair backrest and how this can be translated to seating.

> Digital manufactured custom contour seat

### Why?

We will also consider whether pressure imaging output correlates to a moulded surface required for optimal positioning and pressure relief.

This may also include standard components that can be added under a standard flat cushion such as a ramp or pre-ischial bar.

The benefit from this approach is it can be tailored to the user, keeping size and weight down.

This is a unique approach.

### Key Features

1.	Elements for custom-contoured seat profile based on user scan
2.	Using standard 2D cut standard flat form (so not profiled)
3.	Standard range of supportive components for positioning under cushion
4.	Rigid base
5.	Ramp
6.	Pre-iscial bar
7.	Pommel
8.	Leg gutter/trough
9.	Consider built-in lap strap mount (base would require rigid attachment to base)

## D4U Amp

Mainstream mobile devices such as tablets are often not loud enough for voice output. Additional amplification is necessary to increase the volume of the device.

> Adapted mainstream Bluetooth device amplifier

### Why?

Mainstream devices used as assistive technology devices for voice output often do not have sufficient volume to manage day-to-day conversations. 

### Key Features

1. use low cost, mainstream Bluetooth speaker
2. 3.5mm AUX input to remove delay if any
3. stereo with at least 2.5A per channel
4. USB-C rechargeable connector preferred
5. attached to case or digital device

### Similar or Competing Products

There are a range of amplifiers that can be used with Bluetooth AT products but none designed specifically for this use case. There are assistive technology devices that incorporate amplification.

### Other Information

There is often a delay waking a Bluetooth device up from sleep mode and this can result in the first part of a spoken sentence being missed. This needs further investigation.

## D4U Powerchair

Develop a mobility platform that better facilitates integration and removes technical barriers to innovation in powered mobility.

> Functional feature rich powered mobility

### Why?

Powered wheelchair control system have seen little innovation. Whilst specialist control systems are available, features such as collision avoidance, seeing behind you, line following, simple driving controls for people with low cognition that provide independence are all system that have been developed but are often expensive to design and implement.

Low cost Arduino-based robots offer much of this functionality at minimal costs. 
This product builds on the development of ??? Wheelchair.

### Key Features

1. Single switch (push and go) independent mobility
2. Collison avoidance
3. Line following
4. Obstacle following (wall for example)
5. Mobile device as control interface

## D4U Paediatric Configurable Manual Wheelchair

There is a need for a configurable self-propelling paediatric wheelchair that maximises propulsion efficiency and meets the requirements for stock wheelchairs.

> NHS focussed configurable manual wheelchair

### Why?

Self-propelling wheelchair typically provided by NHS wheelchair services for kids who self-propel are often scaled down, folding adult wheelchairs. This means they are heavy and contain strengthening components that are often not required. Some of the features that are required for efficient propulsion may not be available such as small castors, short wheelbase, rigid frame, low rolling resistance tyres and it may be difficult to configure the frame.

### Key Features

1. Single tube fixed frame design
2. Boltable frame and footrest cross brace to enable reconfiguration
3. Rear wheel position movement
4. Seat to ground height adjustment
5. Standard materials for potential local manufacture
6. Push handles 
7. Configurable seat canvas

## EYEO Basic Wired 

An interface box that has two 3.5mm jack sockets to allow assistive technology switches to be connected as inputs for assistive technology switches. 

> Basic wired AT switch interface

### Why? 

Allows assistive technology switches to control other devices such as mobile devices by acting as if it was a keyboard and sending keystrokes. These can be interpreted computers or other digital devices and use their switch accessibility features. 

### Key Features 

1. Two 3.5mm jack stereo sockets 
2. Enable two channels (switches) per socket using splitter cable 
3. USB C charging.

### Other Notes 

Morse code will require minimum 3 switches (4 if mode/function change is required) - see [Hello Morse](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/morse)
 
## EYEO Basic Wireless 

An interface box that has two 3.5mm jack sockets to allow assistive technology switches to be connected as inputs or for the sockets to act as outputs to emulate assistive technology switches. 

> Adaptable wireless AT switch interface

### Why? 

Allows assistive technology switches to control other devices such as mobile devices by acting as a wireless keyboard or mouse and sending keystrokes or mouse movements. These can be interpreted by devices and use their switch accessibility features.  

### Key Features 

1. Two 3.5mm jack sockets 
2. Enables two channels (switches) per sockets using splitter cable 
3. Adaptable program to change functionality, such as latched switching 
4. Bluetooth connection 
5. USB C charging 
6. 110mA LIPO battery

### Similar or Competing Products 

* [Origin Instruments Tapio](https://www.orin.com/access/tapio/) 
* [Pretorian APPlicator](https://www.pretorianuk.com/applicator)

### Other Notes

* This device could also be powered by using a small power bank (e.g. [Anker PowerCore](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-PowerCore-Ultra-Compact-Fast-Charging-Technology/dp/B01CU1EC6Y/) to give wireless functionality if a Bluetooth development board is used. 
* Outputs require an [optocoupler](https://www.instructables.com/Isolating-circuits-from-your-arduino-with-optocoup/) or similar.
* Also consider ability to solder on cables for serial connections or use JST or similar connector.

## EYEO Switch 

A wired mechanical AT switch design that can be manufactured using both low volume and higher volume manufacturing techniques.

> Wired on/off AT switch

### Why?

The ultimate design combining simplicity, adaptability and modularity (same design for different sizes) has not been achieved. Commercial switches are great quality but can be expensive. Locally manufactured (3D printed) designs can seem to be lower cost but can be problematic to assemble and may not be as durable as volume manufactured components.

### Key Features

1. use commercially available micro switch(es)
2. design readily adaptable for different switches
3. good consideration for cable management, for example shortening the cable with an easy splice mechanism or cable containment
4. circular
5. 3.5mm jack

### Similar or Competing Products

* [Button Switches](https://www.inclusive.com/uk/hardware/switches/button-switches.html)
* [AbleNet](https://www.ablenetinc.com/switches/)
* [Logitech Adaptive Gaming Kit](https://www.logitechg.com/en-gb/products/gamepads/adaptive-gaming-kit-accessories.html)

### Other Notes

AT switches can be expensive and there are a number of key features that need to be considered:

* force required for activation
* activation angle or direction of movement
* audible feedback from activation 
* haptic feedback from activation (how it feels)
* size
* material texture
* cable management

## EYEO Switch+

A cable free assistive technology switch that will daisy chain a wired EYEO Switch (so multiple wired EYEO Switches could connect into an EYEO Switch+ to provide multipl switch input).

> Wireless and modular AT switch

### Why?

With switch-based accessibility devices, cable management can become an issue to keep the system tidy. Troubleshooting then becomes difficult as can connecting components in on a daily basis. Existing systems are expensive costing around £200+

### Key Features

1. use commercially available micro switch(es)
2. design readily adaptable for different switches
3. circular
4. 3.5mm jack
5. Bluetooth connectivity
6. Daisy chain wired EYEO Switch

Similar or Competing Products

* [iSwitch](https://www.pretorianuk.com/iswitch)
* [Blue2 FT](https://www.ablenetinc.com/blue2-ft/)
* [Flic switches](https://flic.io/) are able to send keystrokes. 

The typical approach is the use a wireless adapter with standard AT switches. This device would consist of a single switch unit.

## EYEO Mobility Input

Novel interfaces or access methods not currently developed for mobility products could be used to drive powered mobility devices.

> Mobility device input interface box

### Why?

For someone who is able to accurately guide their finger on a touchscreen mobile device such as a mobile phone. If the finger position was detected on the screen this could then be used to drive the wheelchair proportionally - driven by how far away from an original start point they are.

### Key Features

1. Connect with DB9 9 pin connector on powerchair control system interface box to give proportional or switched control
2. accept switch inputs
3. use on-board or external sensors to drive powerchair functions
4. connect other external devices such as touch screen or keyboard/mouse to send HID commands
5. consider connecting mainstream products with option of dead-man switch to reduce risk

### Similar or Competing Products

A number of powerchair control systems incorporate an intermediate device between the input device (the switches, joystick or head control for example) and the powerchair input module. Examples are:

* [Munevo](https://munevo.com/en)
* [Ability Drive](https://www.tolt.tech/products)
* [Dual Pro Headrest](https://www.sunrisemedical.co.uk/powered-wheelchairs/switch-it/head-controls/dual-pro)
* [Vigo](https://www.sunrisemedical.co.uk/powered-wheelchairs/switch-it/head-controls/gyroset-vigo)

* [RNET Control System](https://www.cw-industrial.com/en-gb/medical-mobility/rnet/input-output-module)

## EYEO Mobility Output

Interface box between the powered wheelchair input device and external integrated devices such as mobile devices, AAC device or environmental control

> Mobility device output interface box

The system used to drive and control a powerchair should be an efficient input method for the user. There is a good chance this input method could be different for other systems too such as environmental control, smart homes or other external devices. To avoid changing between separate input system for each of these devices, an interface box could act as a bridge between these devices.

### Key Features

1. connect with DB9 pin connector on powerchair control system interface box to give proportional or switched control
2. connect with a range of devices
3. consider remote app for control and configuration

### Similar or Competing Products

Powerchair output devices are very rarely used although there may well be benefits.

* [Linx Input/Output Modules](https://www.dynamiccontrols.com/our-products/linx/auxiliary-modules)
* [RNET Input/Output Modules](https://www.cw-industrial.com/en-gb/medical-mobility/rnet/input-output-module)

## EYEO Speech

A specialist case for a mainstream mobile device can be a cost effective assistive technology device.

> Mainstream digital device AT enhancement

### Why?
Adding additional features to a standard mainstream digital device enables them to be used as assistive technology. It allows costs to be significantly reduced compared to dedicated AT devices which often have high investment costs for manufacture for a relatively low volume. Using mainstream devices benefits from cost reductions that economies of scale can bring if the cost of adding additional features uses low investment manufacturing techniques.
Key Features

1. handle
2. adjustable orientation
3. ruggedised surround or case, possibly using mainstream product
4. strap for over shoulder carrying
5. ability to add optional keyguards
6. able to attached mounting system plate
7. digital device agnostic
8. amplified sound output
9. switch access
10. single point charging using USB-C

* [TalkPad](https://thinksmartbox.com/talk-pad/)
* [Versa Kit](https://www.liberator.co.uk/versaspeaker)

### Other Notes

Nobody has nailed this solution for desktop manufacture. May want to consider splitting this into two phases:

* Phase 1 - Items 1-7 above
* Phase 2 - Items 8-11 above with switch access potentially provided by an EYEO Switch or EYEO Switch+ board

## EYEO Max

Assistive technology professionals often require a wide range of devices to assess for solutions. Much of this functionality could be combined into a single device which could be reprogrammed according to the function required.

> Modular AT input/output interface box

### Why?

This is the X80 device initially developed with Ace Centre. It is an interface box that can reprogrammed to change the functionality - kind of one box suits many applications. This makes reuse and second life easier and means assessors do not require as much kit. This adaptable functionality would also give better value for money.

### Key Features

1. USB charging
2. Wireless
3. Swappable inputs and outputs to allow upto 10 inputs/outputs or some combination
4. One switch "pass through" (one switch input will still control switch output without power
5. Buzzer
6. Setting potentiometer
7. solder pads for connecting wiring direct to board 
8. JST header for input and output
9. Multi function/colour LED (e.g. NeoPixel)

### Similar or Competing Products

* [Asterics FABI](https://github.com/asterics/FABI)

### Other Notes

This is a potential development of [Ace Centre’s X80 Project](https://github.com/AceCentre/X80).

## EYEO Audio Split

Splitting the audio generated by a mobile device app could provide different audio feed for different functions. This is a small printed circuit board (PCB) with one Jack Input and two Jack outputs.

> Makes split stereo audio multi-functional

### Why?

Splitting the audio on two channels may be useful for some assistive technology users by giving the channels different function. The left channel could be used for audible feedback to user in a headpiece (spoken audio prompts, beeps) and the other channel providing speech output (through a speaker) to a communication partner.

### Key Features

1. Stereo jack input from digital device audio output (which could be a Bluetooth Receiver Adapter like [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-Soundsync-Bluetooth-Connection-Headphones/dp/B07H5C2BQX) or [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/APEKX-Bluetooth-Headphones-Wireless-Hands-Free/dp/B01MUXYVOA)
2. Two mono jack outputs - HEAD1 and HEAD2
3. When there is a jack plug connected in HEAD1 (i.e. headphone plugged in), one channel connects to this and one channel to the speaker
4. When there is a jack plug connected in HEAD2, both channels will be output to the headphones
5. When there nothing is connected to either HEAD1 or HEAD2, both channels output to speakers
6. Two speakers, similar to those used in EYEO Speech

### Similar or Competing Products

None.

### Other Notes

It may be possible to complete this product using cables alone but requires additional investigation. It will only benefit systems where distint functional audio is different on different channels, such as that produced by [Pasco](https://github.com/AceCentre/pasco) and [Echo]((https://github.com/acecentre/echo).

This [splitter cable](https://www.kenable.co.uk/en/audio-/audio-cables/jack-extensionssplitters/6058-35mm-stereo-jack-plug-to-twin-35mm-mono-sockets-audio-cable-15cm-006058-5055383460588.html) may be useful.

## LIFE2 Powerchair

Using pre-used components from donated wheelchairs, develop a design that makes use of these using a range of adapter plates on a chassis.

> Second life powered mobility product

### Why?

Powered wheelchairs consist of a number of high value components that consume significant energy during their manufacture. While peripheral parts may wear and fail during life, key components often still have a functional life once the product as a whole is written-off for disposal. These include motors, control system and other electrical components. Some items may have been replaced during the life of the product and may also still be usable depending on their last replacement, such as batteries.

There are a range of seating and backrest options on the market, including those forming part of this plan, that could be used to provide the postural element to the wheelchair.

Develop a powerchair chassis with adapter plates that can accommodate a range of used powerchair components from common models.

### Key Features

1. Use motors, control system, castors, wheels from donated wheelchairs
2. Source standard components - armpads, footplates
3. Additional material scrap and recycling, such as metals, will reduce overall cost
Other charities exist, such as Motivation, to encourage local manufacture rather than importing product which is difficult to support and maintain.

• [Global Disability Innovation Hub](https://www.disabilityinnovation.com/)

## MOUNT Mini

Allows small assistive technology devices such as switches to be mounted, positioned and adjusted.

> Small AT device mounting system

### Why?

Mounting systems for small items such as switches can be chunky with large components providing the adjustability. Reducing components required would reduce weight and complexity.

### Key Features

1. Use tool to manipulate and shape mounting tube to reduce joints (and so reducing weight and complexity)
2. Use standard tube
3. Able to fix a range of assistive technology switches
4. Compatible diameter with other manufacturer mounting systems
5. Base fixing that enable ease of removal and consistent repositioning
6. Consider swing-away option

### Similar or Competing Products

* [Rehadapt](https://rehadapt.com/control-mounting/headrest-bundles/)
* [Mo-vis](https://www.mo-vis.com/products/mounting-systems)

### Other Notes

The idea is to form standard alluminium tube either 8mm or 10mm diameter using a [mini tube bender](https://www.screwfix.com/p/rothenberger-lever-pipe-bender-6-8-10mm/79571) to get an approximate shape and then tweak by hand. It would be suitable for users who exert a low force that would not reshape the tube. 

## MOUNT Adjust

Allows the user to unlock, move and lock a digital device such as an iPad or communication device between different position. This could be to adjust to a more comfortable height, swing to the side to allow for other activities or to change position to take a photograph.

> User positionable lockable mounting arm

### Why?

There are many floating arm devices (that can be height adjustable to stay in position once adjusted) on the market for devices such as desktop monitors but they cannot be locked in position. This means they are unsuitable for use on a wheelchair as they would move while the wheelchair is in motion.

### Key Features

1. Unlockable and lockable using a gross movement with one limb
2. Supports its own weight once unlocked and can be adjusted (rotated, raised or lowered)
3. Once locked, the device cannot be adjusted (rotated, raised or lowered)
4. Standard VESA connection
5. 30cm height adjustment

### Similar or Competing Products

* [Ideas for Independent Living](https://ideasfil.com/lift-and-lock.html)
* [Rehadapt](https://rehadapt.com/product/tc-oh/)

### Other Notes

One solution may be to combine the design of a [standard monitor mount](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ErGear-Monitor-Screens-Adjustable-Rotation/dp/B0C7KPNP7T) but adding a locking mechanism. The locking mechanism of the [Manfrotto Variable Fricton Arm](https://www.manfrotto.com/uk-en/photo-variable-friction-arm-with-bracket-244/) may be a useful starting point as this locks and releases with a single release point.

VESA is a [standard mounting interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Display_Mounting_Interface).

## MOUNT Transport

An assistive technology mounting system that was crash-tested and suitable for use in transport would allow device user to travel with their communication devices in place.

> AT mounting system for transport

### Why?

Current guidance for using mounting systems for communication aids generally recommends they are removed if the user is transported in their wheelchair, for example in a wheelchair accessible vehicle or bus. Existing products are not suitable for use in transport - this is specifically excluded by the manufacturers.

### Key Features

1. Crash tested and suitable for use in transport
2. Support devices up to 3kg
3. Accept Daessy or Rehadapt mounting receiver
4. One handed removal
5. Adjustable with mount and device in position

### Similar or Competing Products

* [Rehadapt](https://rehadapt.com/solutions/wheelchair-mounts/standard/)
* [Daessy](https://www.daessy.com/dms/stand_var.html)

## MOUNT Receiver

Receivers on assistive technology mounting systems are not interchangeable and require two hands to fit and remove the device.

> One handed AT device removal

### Why?

Existing device mounting system receivers require two hands to remove and fit the device and it can be difficult to judge if the device a securely locking in place. Devices have been known to fall to the ground as it has not been obvious if they are attached or not.

A mechanism attached to the device that allow one handed removal in the direction of motion would be easier to use and less prone to error. It would be safer a reduces the risk of heavy devices falling to the floor.

### Key Features

1. One handed removal and fitting of the device to the mount
2. Release mechanism on device with handle rather than mount
3. Receiving pin on mount to accept device
4. Self-guiding when replacing the AT device on the mount
5. Passive locking mechanism
6. Engagement of the mechanism is obvious

## OPEN GoBabyGo! 2.0

Adapt a mainstream child’s ride on car so it can be driven by children with physical disabilities using postural support and accessible interfaces.

> Integrated accessible adapted ride-on car

### Why?

GoBabyGo! is an initiative to adapt ride-on electric cars with volunteers to provide a basic mobility system to allow children with disabilities to explore, play and learn through independent mobility.

This involved adapting mainstream kids cars to have more supporting seating and to be controlled using one or more accessibility switches.

There are other low-cost devices that could be used to provide more functionality such as line-following and collision avoidance to give more independence than a single direction. Integration with other technologies such as digital devices for communication or control of the environment would further increase independence and autonomy at a time when their peers would be doing the same.

### Key Features

1.Include the functionality of Makeblock mBot2 for line following, collision avoidance and other control mechanisms
2. Adapt mainstream ride-on care which is steered by varying the speed of two powered wheels (NOT through use of a steering wheel)
3. Position EYEO Speech for communication and digital access

### Other Notes

There are really inspirational videos from Cole Galloway online. The initiative did not really take off in the UK but there are great opportunities to improve this. 

There are two powered mobility devices developed specifically for kids by charities and available in the UK:

* [Bugzi](https://www.merushop.org/bugzi-mayhem-at-qef-community-games/)
* [Wizzybug](https://designability.org.uk/assistive-solutions/wizzybug/)

## OPEN GoBabyGo! 2.0 Seating

Adapt seating on mainstream ride on cars for children who have physical disabilities and postural support needs in sitting.

> Postural support for ride-on cars

### Why?

To complement the mobility and integration features of OPEN GoBabyGo! 2.0 ride-on car, more supportive seating options will benefit users. This will be linked to the 3D Form projects.

### Key Features

1. Low cost
2. Local manufacture using readily available materials or desktop manufacturing
3. Based on D4U 3D seating technologies

### Other Notes

Basing the seating designs on the D4U 3D seating technologies promotes and increases the profile of both products

The types of things used at the moment include foam wedges and inserts, waste pipe and pipe lagging. This gives some minimal support which may be sufficient for some children.

## OPEN Access Move System

Adapt an existing mounting system to better accommodate assistive technology access devices used in assessments and by service users.

> Assistive technology quick release implementation

### Why?

The Manfrotto MOVE is a lockable mounting system that has an application is assistive technology for quick swap out of access devices such as joysticks or specialist switches during assessment or small digital products such as mobile phones mounted onto wheelchairs.

### Key Features

1. Adapter plate for a range of accessibility switches
2. Adapter plate for a range of accessibility joystick
3. Consider adapter for mobile device

## OPEN Modular Hose Switch Mount

Develop a cost-effective module hose based assistive technology mount to provide adjustable device positioning.

> Modular hose assistive technology mount

### Why?

Modular Hose, of which Loc-Line is a well know brand, allows movement and positioning of the attached devices in all directions and allows positioning. Assistive technology switches can be positioned when they are rigidly attached to the end. 

Modular hose is manufactured from acetal copolymer so adhesives to bond it could be investigated to end fittings are fixed.

### Key Features

1. Adapter system for commonly used assistive technology switches
2. Cable running through centre
3. 1/4" UNC mounting to interface with other mounting systems.

### Resources
* [LocLine Modular Hose](https://www.loc-line.com/) 

## OPEN Cable Splicing

There is often a need to split and join cables by those providing assistive technology services to keep cables tidy and reduce clutter – reducing the likelihood of faults developing.

> Reliable low voltage splicing process

### Why?
