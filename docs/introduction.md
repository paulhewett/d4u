# One Page Business Plan

# Key Focus

Design for all of us – agile assistive technology. Develop sustainable, open and adaptable assistive technologies fast. What does this mean?

## Sustainable

Our activities and the products we develop will support the circular economy and be designed with the full product and material lifecycle in mind.

## Open

We will license our devices to make them available for community development and for enhanced support.

## Adaptable

Devices will adapt to users to maximise ability and function. This could be through adjustment, replacing parts, adding or reducing complexity or configuring software to change functions.

# The Market Problem

Traditionally, assistive technology devices are

* Expensive
* Slow to market
* Lack ongoing development, improvement and support at end-of-life
* Lag behind mainstream technology development
* Poorly supported
* 	Engineered not designed

High sale prices are often attributed to high costs per unit sold for:

* Support
* Manufacturing tooling and set up
* Development

Solutions can be:

* Amateurish
* Unfinished
* Still in development
* Unreliable

# Target market

1. Assistive technology services
2. Distributors
3. Private individuals

# Our Solution

There is an opportunity to develop assistive technologies using:

* an agile development process
* existing development platforms such as Arduino for electronic devices
* low cost, desktop and local manufacturing with minimal tooling or machinery investment
* established companies for low volume production processes such as laser cutting and CNC machining where components are outside of local capabilities
* community-led design
* sustainable solutions using a circular design approach.

# Competitors

Product competitors are identified in the Product Development Plan. Similar organisations tend to be in the third sector.

# Sales and Marketing

* Direct Business to Business, e.g. NHS Trusts, third sector and commercial providers
* Paid for and freely available downloadable designs through an online store
* Quality online web support and how-to video guides
* Single page website on primary domain to forward onto relevant channels
* Supporting and developing OpenAssistive - https://openassistive.org/
* Promotion of solutions on  social media
* Exhibiting at small, local events such as [Communication Works](https://acecentre.org.uk/communication-works-2024) and [TechAbility](https://www.techability.org.uk/techability-conference-2024/)

# Milestones

Development will start with products that are rated as requiring least investment and most closely meet company objectives. Income generated by these designs will fund further development.

# Business Plan Additional Notes

## Background

Design4Us Lab Ltd was established as a limited company in 2013 with one employees and provided consultancy design and engineering services primarily for organisations operating in healthcare and assistive technology. This led to full time working with one of the organisations and to ensure HMRC off-payroll working rules (IR35) were not breached a role as a direct employee was taken. The company was dormant from 2020/2021 tax year until 2023/2024 where turnover has had a slight increase due to limited sales and activities.

The original strategy had always been to develop assistive technology products to fill market gaps identified during a 30 year career in assistive technology.

## Product Development Strategy

A robust, objective product development plan will prioritise development based on a RICE score (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) supplemented with Relevance (to company strategic goals) and Investment ratings. 

## Aligned Organisations

* [Motivation](https://motivation.org.uk/)
* [Designability](https://designability.org.uk/)
* [Makers Making Change](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/)
* [MERU](https://www.merushop.org/)
* [Global Disability Innovation Hub](https://www.disabilityinnovation.com/ )

## Online Presence Development

An off-the-shelf online store and payment portal will be used to minimise setup time. This could be either:

* [Shopify Starter](https://www.shopify.com/uk/pricing) at £5 per month (and if required migrate to Shopify Basic at £19 per month)
* [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/pricing/) store on Business for £17 per month. See also [https://www.squarespace.com/online-stores ](https://www.squarespace.com/online-stores)
* [Wix](https://www.wix.com/plans) store on Core at £16 per month

The online store will need to be able to deal with online purchases for physical products shipped to the customer, purchase of digital downloads such as 3D files or specification packs as well as downloads of free designs or resources.
Support will be provided through a documentation theme using a static site generator such [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)  theme hosted in [Github](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or similar.

## Manufacturing Resources

Where possible low-tech, bench/desk-based manufacture will be used to minimise investment costs using manual and powered hand tools unless there are benefits from economies of scale. 

The company has access to the machinery at [STEAMhouse](https://steamhouse.org.uk/) based in Birmingham through the Forward programme and will continue with the [Maker Membership](https://steamhouse.org.uk/memberships/maker-membership/)

# Brand Categories

Ideas in the Product Development Plan have been split between these brand categories:

## 3D

Products likely to be primarily manufactured using 3D printing.

## D4U

Shortened Design4Us for generic products.

## EYEO

This is a play on IO, or input/output, and used for products that are primarily electronic.

## LIFE

Products specifically making use of pre-used components or material to form a new value-added device.

## MOUNT

Mechanical products used to mount or position assistive technology devices.

## OPEN

Products or processes that will be fully open source.

# Product Development Prioritisation

A RICE (Reach – Impact – Confidence – Effort) score has been used to prioritise development. This has been combined with a value for Relevance and Investment to ensure development is aligned with the company’s focus.

## Reach

Spread of potential users:

* 5: International
* 3: National
* 2: Regional
* 1: Local

## Impact

Quantity of potential users:

* 3: High (1000s of units sold, may require manufacturing change for economies of scale)
* 2: Medium (100s of units sold, may require batch production or may make a big difference to small group of users)
* 1: Low (10s of units sold, small or one-off production runs)

## Confidence

Ability to judge barriers to development:

* 5: High (unknown barriers unlikely)
* 2: Medium 
* 1: Low (high risk of unforeseen problems)

## Effort

Length of development time:

* 1: Low (proof of concept within a day or two)
* 4: Medium (several days with some iterations)
* 5: High (weeks with numerous iterations or testing)

## Relevance

Rates alignment with objectives (note this is at the point the assessment and could change as priorities or focus changes):

* 10: Strong
* 3: Some
* 1: Distant

## Investment

Only considers purchases – so cash needed (Effort rates time resource required):

* 5: Low (no tooling required, small volumes at low cost, own manufacture £10’s development
* 3: Medium (some external manufacture, some low cost or homemade tooling or jigs required £100’s to develop)
* 1: High (significant tooling, manufacture external £1000’s to develop)

## Regulatory Framework

Many assistive technology devices (typically except aids for daily living) are classified as Class 1 medical devices under UK and EU regulations. Some are “borderline devices” as defined by Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) – the key question will be whether the primary function is a medical one.

Standards relevant to devices will vary depending on the device type. An important and useful standard is ISO 21856: 2022.
