Powered wheelchairs and mobility scooters are 'invalid carriages' in law.

Classifications:

Class 1
Manual Wheelchairs

Class 2
Powered Wheelchairs
- 4mph maximum speed
- Designed to be used on pavements
- 113.4kg maximum unladen weight

Class 3
Powered Wheelchairs
- Over 4mph up to 8mph maximum speed
- Equipped to be used on road as well as pavement
- Must ravel in the direction of traffic
- Must not be used by someone under 14 years of age
- 150kg maximum unladen weight
- Must have a way of indicating travelling at 4mph
- Overall width less than 0.85m
- Must have a horn
- Must have rear view mirror
- Must be 14 years or older

The unladen weight for either Class 2 or Class 3 can be up to 200kg including “necessary user equipment” means equipment that is necessary for the specific clinical, postural, hygienic, caring or nursing requirement of the usual user.

If a Class 2 vehicle travels on the road at night, such as when there is no pavement, it must have lights

If travelling at night, lights must be used and you should travel in the direction of the traffic

Class 3 vehicles can be used on the pavement but they must not travel faster than 4mph.

Applying the Highway Code

- when used on the road, should follow rules for other vehicles
- when used on the pavement, should follow the rules for pedestrians
- must not be used on motorways
- when used on unrestricted dual carriageway where speed limit is over 50-mph, must have a flashing amber beacon

What does this mean for service delivery?

Large powerchairs may be approaching the 200kg unladen weight limit and may be nearing the 85cm width limit. Care will need to be taken to ensure user knows the relevant legal requirements.
